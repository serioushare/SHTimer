# Simple stopwatch
> This example can be build within JSFiddle or CodePen.

This example demonstrates how to build a simple stopwatch. The most important function is to count the time but we might want some more features, like keeping track of lap times. We'll also need some simple UI to let the user control the stopwatch. 

#### Features
* Display the current time
* Start, stop and reset the timer
* List previously saved times
* Convert milliseconds to a readable time

#### Steps
* [Setting up the project environment][step_1]
* [Adding the first functions][step_2]
* [Creating the basic interface][step_3]
* Formating the output
* Add a mark function to keep track of multiple events
