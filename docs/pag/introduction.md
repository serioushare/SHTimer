# Inroduction

While working on an other project, I found myself in need of a javascript timer that had some more complex features. For instance, it needed to go both ways (counting up or down), work with times below zero, support different speeds, and trigger events at irregular points instead of a constant interval.

The goal of SeriousTimer is to offer a timer that takes minimal code if you need simple operation, but also offer lots of options for more complex scenarios.

## Features
* Control the state (play/pause/stop)
* Control the direction (forward/backward)
* Control the speed (ie. fast-forward/backward)
* Trigger at a contant interval
* Trigger at predefined points on the timer
* Cap the time within a set range
* Loop over the defined range
* Use event listeners to respond to events happening within the timer
